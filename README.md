# Payroll-Mate

## Description

### For this project, I used my newly acquired skills to develop an Employee Payroll Tracker. I named it "Payroll Mate". The use of this application is to assist users in effectively managing and recording employee payroll information through an intuitive and interactive interface.

- Users can input employee information by clicking the "Add Employees" button, which initiates a series of prompts. These prompts gather data such as the employee's first name, last name, and salary.

- Application will also stop users from inputting numbers for name fields.

- Users can add as many employees as required or cancel the application at any time.

- After the user completes the inputting of employee data, the application presents the list of employees, as a table on the webpage, the names are sorted by last name alphabetically. This ensures that locating specific employee entries is more efficient and easier to control.

- The console shows computed and aggregated data, including metrics like the average employee salary, providing a rapid overview of the organization's payroll expenses.
